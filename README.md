# Distracted_Driver_Detection

This project aims to build a deep learning model capable of detecting drivers who are distracted. The dataset to be used has been purpose-built and was published to Kaggle by State Farm Insurance. The published dataset contains images of drivers seated at the steering wheel of a car, exhibiting various behaviours. Some of these behaviours are negligent and dangerous, and we have assigned them to a set labelled ‘distracted’.
